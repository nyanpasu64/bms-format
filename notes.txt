#### LOOPING

0xEF initializes a loop command to another address.
    0xEF: loop
        u8 ctr
            jump: ctr=0

        u16 addr

        # There is no limit to the number of loops in a N-SPC file.
        # But AMK limits them for some reason.

    0x00: end loop/track


Where is loop data stored?
    // We're in a loop now, which is represented as channel 8.
Loop data is stored separately, but entered together in the .txt file.
- So we'll paste the first occurrence of a called section into the loop body.

Normal loop[] stored in Channel 8



#### SUBLOOPS (AMK only)

0xE6 0x00
    loop...
0xE6 #loops
